## Overview

This repository contains the tbp-parser tool which parses the JSON output of [Jody Phelan's TBProfiler tool](https://github.com/jodyphelan/TBProfiler). Available as a downloadable Python package and as a Docker image, tbp-parser converts the output of TBProfiler into four files.

Please reach out to us at [support@theiagen.com](mailto:support@theiagen.com) if you would like any custom file formats and/or changes to these output files that suit your individual needs.
