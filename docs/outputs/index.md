title: "Output Overview"
---

`tbp-parser` produces four files as outputs. See each individual page for more details on how they are constructed and what they contain:

- [Laboratorian report](laboratorian.md)
- [LIMS report](lims.md)
- [Looker report](looker.md)
- [Coverage report](coverage.md)

The four reports contain a wealth of information. The reports can be ordered from increasing to decreasing verbosity as follows: the laboratorian report, the LIMS report, the Looker report, and the coverage report. The same information is used in all four reports but at differing levels of verbosity.

Running `tbp-parser` as part of TheiaProk on Terra produces additional outputs. You can find that information in the [TheiaProk Outputs on Terra](theiaprok.md) page.
