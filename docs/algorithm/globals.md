title: Global Variables
---

The following global variables are used in the `tbp-parser` algorithm. These variables are used to determine columns in the output files, thresholds for quality control, and various other look-up tables for the algorithm.

These variables can be overwritten using a configuration file. For more information on how to overwrite these variables, please see the [Configuration File](../inputs/inputs.md#configuration-file) section.

## Global Variables

The content of the global variables can be found by browsing the [globals.py](https://github.com/theiagen/tbp-parser/blob/main/tbp_parser/globals.py) file on GitHub.

Some global variables are excluded as their modifications will either have no effect or will break the algorithm without further changes.
